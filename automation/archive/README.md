# Archive of automation files

This directory contains copies of files moved from the active automation tree during a cleanup step.
Files are preserved here so they can be restored if needed. Each file is named with a suffix showing its original relative path.

If you want to permanently remove these files from the repository, delete them from this folder and commit that change.
